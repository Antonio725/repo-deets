## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

The app opens up a splash screen with a random image from a list. After a few seconds, the Home Screen is shown, and the user can input a search key to search repositories, or go into the About Screen to change the Dark Mode. 

The user can read data from the list, or click on an item to open the Detail Screen about the selected item. Returning to the Home Screen, the user can choose to navigate pages of results, or change the quantity of repositories presented in the list.
